## Abstract

This paper provides a practical framework for applying the theory of Reverse Quantum Shielding to therapeutic interventions, particularly for individuals on the autism spectrum. Building upon the core hypothesis that neurodivergent brains experience altered environmental decoherence due to quantum shielding effects, this work proposes methods to reintroduce controlled "interference"—or healthy decoherence—through targeted electromagnetic, auditory, or sensory stimuli. The goal is to modulate brainwave entrainment and neural coherence without disrupting savant abilities or unique perceptual processing. By integrating EEG mapping, AI-assisted pattern recognition, and non-invasive neurostimulation techniques such as tACS, this paper outlines a step-by-step model for real-world testing and development of personalized tuning protocols. The proposed therapeutic approach offers a bridge between quantum neurological theory and actionable treatment design, with the potential to enhance cognitive integration, social connectivity, and adaptive function in autism spectrum conditions.
