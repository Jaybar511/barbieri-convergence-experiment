## Abstract

This paper explores the entanglement-based model of consciousness, proposing that conscious awareness arises not solely from neural complexity but from the quantum entanglement of informational states within and beyond the brain. The theory suggests that consciousness is a non-local phenomenon, partially embedded in the quantum fabric of reality, and capable of interacting with other entangled systems through shared informational coherence. The paper introduces the concept of “Entangleme” as a framework where conscious agents are linked via quantum networks that enable intuition, synchronicity, and perception across classical boundaries. Drawing from quantum biology, neuroscience, and reported anomalous experiences, the theory positions consciousness as both an emergent and entangled system. This view opens new avenues for understanding memory, intuition, non-local communication, and the role of attention in shaping reality. It also sets the stage for integrating quantum models into next-generation artificial intelligence and brain-computer interfaces.
