## Abstract

This paper introduces a novel framework suggesting that autism spectrum traits may arise from quantum-level sensory filtering mechanisms operating outside classical neural processing. Rather than viewing hypersensitivity or sensory overload as deficits, this model proposes that autistic perception results from reduced decoherence in specific neural circuits, allowing raw quantum information to persist longer in conscious awareness. By reversing traditional models—where sensory gating is presumed to fail—this theory explores how autistic cognition may reflect enhanced coherence and signal fidelity. The result is a perceptual state marked by deep pattern recognition, environmental entanglement, and non-linear logic access. This first installment lays the foundation for a new neurocoherent paradigm grounded in quantum biology and observer-dependent cognition.
