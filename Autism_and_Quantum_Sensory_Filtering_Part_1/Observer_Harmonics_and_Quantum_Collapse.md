## Abstract

This paper proposes that the act of observation in quantum systems is fundamentally governed by the unique vibrational frequency of the observer, rooted in both neurological brainwave patterns and DNA-level preconditioning. Building on established quantum phenomena—such as Schrödinger’s cat and the tree-in-the-forest paradox—it explores how conscious observers collapse quantum states not through awareness alone, but through individualized frequency-based interference. The theory asserts that perception is not universally aligned, and that neurodivergent brains (such as those associated with autism or schizophrenia) represent alternative observer states that yield different quantum outcomes. By introducing the concept of trillions of synaptic microfrequencies acting as harmonic interference agents, the paper argues for a new framework in which quantum state collapse is not a random event, but a deterministic interaction based on the observer’s internal harmonic signature. This has implications for both consciousness studies and the design of future quantum-integrated artificial intelligence systems.
