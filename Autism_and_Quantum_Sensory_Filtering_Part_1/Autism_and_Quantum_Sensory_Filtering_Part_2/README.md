## Abstract

This continuation expands upon the quantum-neural interface proposed in Part 1, focusing on the therapeutic application of quantum coherence modulation for individuals on the autism spectrum. It introduces a model where neurodivergent brainwave patterns can be harmonized via controlled decoherence, restoring functional interference necessary for dynamic sensory integration. Using principles from quantum field theory and neuroplasticity, this paper outlines a theoretical framework for reversing maladaptive coherence statesâ€”without suppressing beneficial savant traits. The result is a novel approach to quantum-informed therapy that preserves identity while enhancing perceptual regulation.
