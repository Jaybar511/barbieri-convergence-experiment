## Abstract

This paper introduces a novel theoretical model for quantum information processing titled Quantum Gate-State Propagation via Entangled Qubit Mirroring. The framework proposes that qubits entangled across space or systems can serve as mirrored logic states, allowing for the coherent propagation of quantum gate operations without direct observation. This model suggests that logic gates can be virtually “applied” across entangled pairs, enabling inference of outcomes on one qubit based on operations executed on its twin. By leveraging superposition and maintaining strict non-observance, the mirrored qubit retains a dynamically updated quantum state—making it a functional proxy for computation or communication. The theory provides a foundation for more efficient quantum networking, reduced decoherence during computation, and potential new architectures for entangled quantum processors. It also opens the door to further exploration into quantum logic inference without traditional measurement, blurring the lines between computation and entanglement steering.
